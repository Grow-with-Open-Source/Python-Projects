# YouTube Relevance Finder with Gemini AI

This Python script searches YouTube for recent videos based on a user query and ranks them by relevance using Google's Gemini AI model. It uses YouTube API and filters results by duration and recency, scores video titles for relevance, and returns the top-ranked videos.

## 🔍 Features

- Searches YouTube for videos from the past 14 days
- Filters videos by duration (4–20 minutes)
- Uses Gemini AI to score title relevance to a query
- Prints the top relevant video links with scores and metadata

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
````

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install google-api-python-client google-generativeai
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file or export in terminal:

   ```bash
   export YT_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

You'll be prompted to enter a search query. The script will then display a list of the top relevant YouTube videos based on that query.
